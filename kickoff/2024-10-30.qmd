## MUD Final project

* Timeline
    * Idea/plan/partners -- now
    * Work one week in Nov before Thanksgiving
    * Mon-Tue-Wed before Thanksgiving
    * you might have time after break depending on your slot (slots allocated randomly, will post schedule after the quiz due Friday closes).
* Where to find datasets 
    * Choose one connected to your policy interests. 
    * It will be better for your job applications / portfolio if you choose the dataset, not me. 
    * Public datasets are everywhere: Google cloud, Kaggle, city's open data portals, replication files for academic papers


## PS3 debrief

* Overall students did very well, not a lot of systematic or correlated errors.
* Some students wrote answers and did not present any git output, we marked them down since we could not verify their answers

## PS4 small changes I

We updated the problem set in the student repo.

* In "Calculate zip code’s distance to the nearest hospital", we simplified 2. You no longer have to create a function to see if the polygons intersect.
* In "Calculate zip code’s distance to the nearest hospital", we eliminated 4a. You no longer have to time the join of the subset first.
* If you did these already -- they will count as extra credit

## PS4 small changes II

* Mitch noted that there was a discrepancy in the template (which had subquestions) and the problem set (which in the student repo did not). Thank you!
    * The problem set has been updated
* The template was missing some of the header material
    * This issue is fixed (but not needed ) 
    * Going forward, we will put header material in exactly one place, which will be the template

## Remaining tech issues with spatial packages
- If you find you are still having issues with spatial packages:
    1. Try to implement Dema's mini-lesson on virtual environments
    2. Look at endorsed answers on Ed for solutions to edge cases (e.g., issue with `fiona`)
    3. Post in Ed thread: we will have a TA reach out to 1-1
