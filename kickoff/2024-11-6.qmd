## Problem set 5 questions 
- Like in PS4, you can work on PS5 solo
- Late tokens for paired problem sets: we require *two late tokens* for paired problem set
\vspace{2ex}
    - Can have 1 token from each partner
    - Or, if you have a generous partner, two from one partner 
- Recall we drop your lowest problem set score

## Lab
- You can go to any other section's lab for TA/faculty office hours
- But if you typically go to the *second* Wednesday lab and want to go to the *first* one: come after the first 10 minutes to avoid the quiz
