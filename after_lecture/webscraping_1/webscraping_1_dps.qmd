## **Do-pair-share: solution**
1. Inspect the HTML code on the [Harris Specialization in Data Analytics](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/design-your-path/specializations/specialization-data-analytics) page
2. What is the tag associated with the text: "Students in the Master of Science in Computational Analysis and Public Policy..."? 
    ```{html}
    <strong>
    ```
3. What are examples of other content associated with the same tag?
    ```{html}
    <strong>Still have questions?</strong>
    ```
4. Look at attributes for tags with links. Some of them do not appear to be "full" links. Can you explain why?
    ```{html}
    <a href "/admissions">Admissions</a>
    ```
    This appears to be a *relative path*, whereas the *absolute path* is: 

   `https://harris.uchicago.edu/admissions`
