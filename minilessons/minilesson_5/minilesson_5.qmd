## 
#### Objectives
- What is a Virtual Environment?
- Create, Activate, & Deactivate Virtual Environments
- Use .gitignore & requirements.txt

<br />

#### What is an Environment?
An "environment" in Python is the context in which a Python program runs that consists of an interpreter and any number of installed packages. <br />
*Read more about environments [**here**.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments)*

## Virtual Environments
- Stored in a .venv or venv folder within the project
- Packages installed in the environment are saved in this folder
- Environment is isolated from other projects, don’t interfere with each other
- **Easy to delete and recreate** from scratch
- **Project code** stays **outside** the environment folder
- **Not portable** — recreate the environment at the new location

##
#### .gitignore
- *Generate*: <br />
`code .gitignore`. <br />
In `.gitignore` add `.venv/` <br />
- *Use*: Excludes unnecessary files from being pushed

<br />

#### requirements.txt
- *Generate*: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- *Use*: Tracks installed packages and their versions. 
- *Install*: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
