# Introduction (5.2)

## Intro: roadmap

-   motivation
-   textbook
-   `requirements.txt`
-   types of geo data
-   attribute data
-   storage for geo data

## Motivation

-   For many datasets, the fundamental unit of observation is geographic
    -   a place
    -   a road
    -   a building
    -   a county
-   By the end of this section (two classes), you will be able to 
    - Represent geographic vector objects in Python using the `shapely` library
    - Understand the basic data structures and methods of geopandas GeoDataFrames
    - Execute common geometric operations with points, lines and polygons
    - Spatial join operations

## Textbook

[Introduction to Python for Geographic Data Analysis](https://pythongis.org) by Henrikki Tenkanen, Vuokko Heikinheimo & David Whipp

Book has three parts:

1.  Intro to Python (you know this already)
2.  Intro to Geographical Information Systems (GIS) with Python
3.  Case Studies (this part is actually not written yet)

We are going to teach material from Chapters 5 and 6 in Section 2.

## `requirements.txt`

(We will elaborate more on what this file is in minilesson on Wednesday)

`shapely` -- Manipulation and analysis of geometric objects in the Cartesian plane.

`geopandas` -- Geometric objects nested within a standard pandas data frame

```{python}
import shapely
from shapely import Polygon, Point
```

## Vector vs raster data

![](pictures/vector_vs_raster.jpg){height="80%"}

**Vector** data records points, lines and shapes. **Raster** data records pixels. 

Discussion question -- brainstorm examples of each type of data.

<!--CC to GGG:  would be good to give a few "real world" examples (from research?) 
Redlining
Carl Kitchens' highway research
Satellite? research 

MS to GGG: relatedly, what are the pro's and con's of each type? Something like: 
vectors can be scaled up or down without losing integrity, but raster allows you to store fine-grained data at the pixel-level (e.g., plotting a continuous measure)
-->

## Examples of vector data

![](pictures/vector_data_model.jpg){height="100%"}


## Building blocks of vector data

| Data type         | Well-known text (WKT)                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `Point`           | `(25 60.5)`                            |
| `LineString`      | `(24.5 61, 25 60.5, 25.5 61)`          |
| `Polygon`         | `(24.5 61, 25 60.5, 25.5 61, 24.5 61)` |
| `MultiPoint`      | `((25 60.5) (25.5 61))`                |
| `MultiLineString` | ...                                    |
| `MultiPolygon`    | ...                                    |

**Well-known text** is the version of the data which is easily interpretable to a human

We will discuss how to read these shortly!

## Attribute data

In virtually every example, we will associate **attribute** data of the type that might appear in a table with vector data.

Examples of data that would associate with a *point*:

* particulate matter (pollution)
* temperature
* altitude

Discussion question: what type of data would you associate with...

1.  ...a building?
2.  ...a geographic area?

<!-- ZZZ this is a pretty open-ended brainstorm, but here are a few examples in case people get stuck
1. address 
2. population, GDP-->

<!-- MS to GGG: we should differentiate between attributes that are built-in to each geography type (e.g., centroid and length) as opposed to attributes like the examples listed above that are not related to the geography per se 

Also we should note that we're not covering every possible attribute for each geometry type -- students should read the documentation, which lists all of the possible attributes. https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.Point.html#shapely.Point -->


## Intro: summary

- vector data
- raster data
- attribute data
- The spatial lectures here will focus on vector and attribute data because of time limitations.

# Representing geographic data in vector format (6.1)

## geo data in vectors: roadmap

-   `Point`
-   `LineString`
-   `Polygon`

Within each data type, we will cover creation, Well Known Text (WKT), and coordinates.



## `Point`: creating geometries

```{python}
from shapely import Point

point = Point(2.2, 4.2)
point
```

<!-- ZZZ
MS comment: I anticipate students will ask, what do these coordinates meann? ChatGPT says the coordinates depend on a specific coordinate system, but we haven't defined a coordinate system yet. (https://chatgpt.com/share/66eb3cc4-8690-800f-b01f-8153f30dc78b) Without defining a coordinate system, can we say that these coordinates just represent locations relative to some arbitrary point on the screen -->

## `Point`: Well Known Text (WKT) representation

```{python}
print(point) #extracts WKT
point.wkt    #gets WKT directly

point3D = Point(9.26, -2.456, 0.57)
print(point3D)
```

`WKT` gives you a plaintext representation of where the point is. It contrasts with Well Known Binary (`WKB`) which stores geo data in the way which is most efficient for the computer. Wikipedia has some nice [examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) of how the same point is stored by WKT and WKB.

## `Point`: Coordinate representation

```{python}
type(point.coords)
```

```{python}
list(point.coords)
```


## `Point`: extraction methods

```{python}
print(point.x)
```

```{python}
print(point.xy)
```



## `LineString`: creating geometries

```{python}
from shapely import Point, LineString

point1 = Point(2.2, 4.2)
point2 = Point(7.2, -25.1)
point3 = Point(9.26, -2.456)

line = LineString([point1, point2, point3])
line_from_tuples = LineString([(2.2, 4.2), (7.2, -25.1), (9.26, -2.456)])
line
```

## `LineString`: creation syntax

These two input methods produce the same output. No "right" way. Use whichever way is more convenient in your application.

```{python}
line = LineString([point1, point2, point3])

line_from_tuples = LineString([(2.2, 4.2), (7.2, -25.1), (9.26, -2.456)])
```

## `LineString` discussion questions

1.  What output should we expect if we run `print(line)`? Write down your guess on your MUD card before you run it at the computer.
2.  How can you access the Well Known Text representation?


<!-- ZZZ 1. LINESTRING (2.2 4.2, 7.2 -25.1, 9.26 -2.456) 2. line.wkt -->

## `LineString` coordinate representation

```{python}
list(line.coords)
```

## `LineString` attributes
```{python}
xcoords = list(line.xy[0])
ycoords = list(line.xy[1])

print(xcoords)
print(ycoords)
```

```{python}
length = line.length
print(f"Length of our line: {length:.2f} units")
```


## `Polygon`: creating geometries

```{python}
from shapely import Polygon
poly = Polygon([point1, point2, point3])
poly
```


## `Polygon`: WKT

```{python}
poly.wkt
```

Note the double parentheses

## `Polygon`: attributes

```{python}
print("Polygon centroid: ", poly.centroid)
print("Polygon Area: ", poly.area)
print("Polygon Bounding Box: ", poly.bounds)
print("Polygon Exterior: ", poly.exterior)
print("Polygon Exterior Length: ", poly.exterior.length)
```

## `Polygon`: example II

```{python}
exterior = [(-180, 90), (-180, -90), (180, -90), (180, 90)]
poly_without_hole = Polygon(shell=exterior)
poly_without_hole
```

## `Polygon`: example II with a hole

```{python}
# Define the hole coordinates (a single hole in this case)
holes_coordinates = [[(-170, 80), (-170, -80), (170, -80), (170, 80)]]
poly_with_hole = Polygon(shell=exterior, holes=holes_coordinates)
poly_with_hole
```



## Do-pair-Share

1.  Create a triangle
2.  Create a square
3.  Create a circle (hint: look up the `buffer` method in `shapely`)
